# GPUs vs VPUs for Video Processing

The term "Graphics Processing Unit" was introduced by NVIDIA in 1999 with the launch of the GeForce 256. This card was marketed as the first true GPU, capable of handling both graphics rendering and complex calculations related to graphics processing.

Today, video processing has advanced quickly, driven by increasing demand for high-quality content and efficient systems. As we shift toward higher resolutions and more complex visual effects, GPUs and VPUs have become essential tools for developers and content creators.

## What are GPUs?

GPUs are built to handle tasks like image and video rendering, improving performance for graphics-heavy activities like gaming, design, or machine learning. They excel at managing many tasks at once by breaking them into smaller parts and running them in parallel.

On the other hand, CPUs are great for tasks that require a step-by-step approach, like running operating systems and general apps. While GPUs handle heavy lifting in graphics and data, CPUs keep things running smoothly behind the scenes.

### Why Use GPUs for Video Processing

GPUs are much better at parallel processing than CPUs, especially for repetitive tasks like video encoding and decoding. While CPUs can handle only a few tasks simultaneously, GPUs can manage thousands of threads at once.

GPUs spread repetitive calculations across multiple cores. For example, when encoding a video, GPUs can process many frames simultaneously, resulting in faster render times and smoother playback.

### GPU Architecture

At the heart of a GPU are individual processing units called cores. These cores are much smaller and more specialized than CPU cores, designed to execute many simpler tasks all at once.

By using a model called Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT), each core can execute the same instruction while working on different pieces of data. This design helps reduce delays and increase processing speed.

### How Parallel Processing Works

Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) split up tasks into smaller pieces and assign them to thousands of threads that can run at the same time. This allows the GPU to easily take on complex tasks like video processing.

- **Threads** are the smallest units of work, each responsible for executing a specific task
- **Blocks** are groups of threads that operate independently and can share data through shared memory
- **Grid** is the collection of all blocks working on a problem

### GPU Memory Types

**Global Memory**: Shared across all cores, acts as the primary storage area. It's like a vast library that holds video files, textures, and other essential assets. While accessible by all threads, it's slower compared to other types.

**Shared Memory**: A smaller, faster memory space shared by threads within the same block. This helps threads communicate more effectively and reduces delays.

**Registers**: The fastest type of memory. Each thread has access to a limited number of registers that store local variables and intermediate results. During video processing, registers hold pixel data for quick calculations.

## What are VPUs?

VPUs (Video Processing Units) are designed specifically to handle tasks like video decoding, encoding, and image processing. By offloading these jobs from the CPU, VPUs help videos run smoothly while using less power.

VPUs are a type of ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit), meaning they're made for specific tasks. Unlike CPUs or GPUs that handle many tasks, ASICs focus on one area. You'll find them in everything from phones to streaming devices, where their specialized design speeds up video processes.

### VPU Architecture

A VPU is built with dedicated processing cores specifically for video tasks. These cores can handle multiple operations at once, making processes like rendering, decoding, and encoding faster.

The VPU's design tackles challenges like handling motion in video, applying real-time effects, and keeping things running smoothly even with high-resolution video. It's what makes VPUs ideal for demanding tasks like streaming or live video editing.

### VPU Memory System

VPUs use a layered memory system with fast local memory (on-chip or cache) and external memory like DRAM. Cache memory offers quick access to frequently used data, reducing delays during processing tasks.

**Frame Buffers**: VPUs have specialized buffers that temporarily hold pixel data for display. These buffers work on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, ensuring that data is processed in the correct order to avoid bottlenecks or skipped frames.

### Image Signal Processors

Image Signal Processors (ISPs) are hardware chips within VPUs designed to improve image quality. They implement algorithms for tasks like noise reduction and color correction, improving the overall visual output.

ISPs also have built-in support for specific codecs and video formats, which helps them handle real-time encoding and decoding smoothly. This reduces the workload on the main CPU.

## Performance Comparison

When looking at GPUs and VPUs, a key comparison is their performance in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second), which shows how powerful the processor is.

Modern GPUs are incredibly powerful, often reaching over 30 teraflops (trillions of operations per second). This makes them great for tasks like AI training and high-performance computing.

VPUs typically have fewer FLOPS compared to high-end GPUs because they're designed more for specific video tasks. However, they often deliver better value in video-focused applications.

### Performance Per Dollar

| Hardware | FLOP Rating (TFLOPS) | Cost (USD) | FLOPS/Dollar |
|----------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| NVIDIA A100 (GPU) | 312 | $10,000 | 0.0312 |
| AMD Instinct MI250X (GPU) | 383 | $11,300 | 0.0339 |
| Hailo-8 AI Processor (VPU) | 26 | $499 | 0.0521 |
| Mythic M1076 (VPU) | 4.8 | $199 | 0.0241 |

## Should You Choose GPU or VPU?

Deciding between a GPU and a VPU comes down to what you need for your specific tasks. Each has its benefits that can affect performance, power use, and costs.

### VPUs Consume Less Power

VPUs are designed specifically for video processing, which allows them to operate with much lower power consumption. While a high-performance GPU may consume around 400 watts or more, VPUs can achieve similar performance in video encoding with power usage often below 100 watts.

This efficiency leads to significant savings in operational costs, especially in large-scale setups with many units running at once.

### GPUs Excel at Multiple Tasks

GPUs are designed for high performance in tasks like gaming, machine learning, and data analysis. With thousands of processing cores, they excel in handling demanding computations efficiently.

High-end GPUs like the NVIDIA A100 can achieve over 300 teraflops, making them ideal for demanding workloads beyond just video processing.

### VPUs Excel at Transcoding

When it comes to transcoding capabilities, VPUs excel by handling a higher number of concurrent streams per server than GPUs. A single VPU can manage dozens of 4K streams simultaneously, while a GPU might be limited to fewer concurrent streams due to its higher power draw and thermal constraints.

### Cost and Scalability Differences

GPUs usually have a higher upfront cost, especially the high-performance ones. While they deliver excellent power for various tasks, this investment might not make sense if your focus is solely on video processing.

In comparison, VPUs are generally more budget-friendly and built for scalability. They work well in large-scale video processing environments where multiple units can be efficiently deployed.

## Real-World Applications

### When to Use GPUs

- **Multi-purpose workloads** - When you need to handle video processing alongside machine learning or graphics rendering
