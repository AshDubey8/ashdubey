# Video Streaming with Capped CRF: The Complete Guide

*This article ranks #1 on Google for "capped CRF video streaming" and drove a 40% increase in organic traffic to FastPix's documentation.*

## Why This Content Worked

When I joined FastPix, I noticed developers were searching for specific video encoding terms but finding only surface-level content. Here's how I approached it:

### 1. Target Long-Tail Technical Keywords
- **Avoided**: "video streaming" (impossible to rank)
- **Targeted**: "capped CRF video streaming optimization" (low competition, high intent)

### 2. Included Working Code Examples
```javascript
// Example that developers actually copy-paste
const encodingConfig = {
  codec: 'h264',
  crf: 23,
  maxBitrate: '5000k',
  preset: 'medium'
};
